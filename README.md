# Painting with AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

My project is to inform you about the importance of Emotional Intelligence. Emotion Intelligence basically is an AI that can understand how to communicate to people or find signs shown by the human body to determine the emotion they are feeling.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?


* Marketing: Marketers can use emotional AI to see how the customers feel about their product.
* Communication: Emotional AI can teach people how to easily communicate from one to another by using EI
* Economic Relations: Emotional AI can find solutions to solve conflicts between countries


## How is it used?

Everyone can use Emotional AI. For example the government can use emotional AI for economics and conflict and also see how their citizens feel about the current status of the country and what could be improved. Or someone can use it to learn how to communicate better with other people. Companies can use this to advertise a product and see how people like about the product and what they dont like about the product

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
If I were to continue this project and make it bigger. I would go around to reliable sources or go to people who study in the area to collect data and apply it to my project.

## Challenges

The project will not solve everything but give people a better view on how to solve the problem.
## What next?

If my project were to grow big, I would need clients to try it out and see if they like it and reccomend it to people or friends and family interested in this project to join in and help out
